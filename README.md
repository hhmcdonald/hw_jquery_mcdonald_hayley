## Resources

* [Git Book Branching & Merging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) - I used this as a reference to make sure I was switching between branches properly. I got this link from a previous lecture.

## Comments

I solely used my notes from the lectures over the past couple weeks for this assignment. I feel confident about my work which is a nice feeling after the last assignment. I feel like I have a good grasp on the concept of jQuery, and it seems to make much more sense in my mind than pure JavaScript. I really tried to take thorough notes and watched a couple of the lectures multiple times. I really enjoyed learning jQuery and can easily see how useful it will be in my career in Web Design. I loved this topic, and I hope it shows in this assignment!
